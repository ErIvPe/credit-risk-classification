## Overview of the Analysis

In this section, describe the analysis you completed for the machine learning models used in this Challenge. This might include:

   The main purpose of this analysis was to have the machine learning models predict the loan risk of borrowers. The financial data we had to go off of was the loan size, borrower income, debt_to_income, num_of_accounts, derogatory_marks, and the total_debt. These varaiables were used to decide if people would be capable of taking the loan and be able to afford to pay us back. Throughout this analysis we used logistic regression to help us get reports on the accuracy of our data. resampling method helped the machine model be more accurate in determing high risk accounts with the data we have.


## Results


* Machine Learning Model 1:
  * Description of Model 1 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.
    - Accuracy: 0.9494259906569136
            This means that innaccuracies can happen at around 5% of all accounts.
    
    - Precision: For Healthy Accounts: 100%
                 For Risk Accounts: 86%
            Healthy accounts were all able to be close together while the risk accounts were spread out.
    - Recall Scores: For Healthy Accounts: 100%
                     For Risk Accounts: 90%


* Machine Learning Model 2:
  * Description of Model 2 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.
    - Accuracy: 0.99
            
    
    - Precision: For Healthy Accounts: 100%
                 For Risk Accounts: 84%
            Healthy accounts were all able to be close together while the risk accounts were spread out.
    - Recall Scores: For Healthy Accounts: 100%
                     For Risk Accounts: 99%
## Summary


   I would not recommend the first machine learning model because it may lead to many errors which can end up very negatively impacting peoples lives. The second model was significantly better at telling high risk loans making it easier to do safe loans and keep the company from giving loans that wont be paid back.
